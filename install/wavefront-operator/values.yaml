  #     selectors:
  #       labels:
  #         k8s-app:

  #.    port: 8080
  #     path: /metrics
  #     prefix: kube.prom-example.

  ## Wavefront Collector resource requests and limits
  ## Make sure to keep requests and limits equal to keep the pods in the Guaranteed QoS class
  ## Ref: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 256Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 256Mi

## Wavefront Proxy is a metrics forwarder that is used to relay metrics to the Wavefront SaaS service.
## It can receive metrics from the Wavefront Collector as well as other metrics collection services
## within your cluster. The proxy also supports preprocessor rules to allow you to further filter
## and enhance your metric names, and tags. Should network connectivity fall between the proxy and
## Wavefront SaaS service, the proxy will buffer metrics, which will be flushed when connectivity resumes.
## Ref: https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html
proxy:
  enabled: true
  image:
    repository: wavefronthq/proxy
    tag: 4.38

  ## The port number the proxy will listen on for metrics in Wavefront data format.
  ## This is by default 2878
  # metricPort: 2878

  ## The no. of replicas for Wavefront Proxy. Defaults to 1
  # size: 3

  ## The port nubmer the proxy will listen on for tracing spans in Wavefront trace data format.
  ## This is usually 30000
  # tracePort: 30000

  ## The port nubmer the proxy will listen on for tracing spans in Jaeger data format.
  ## This is usually 30001
  # jaegerPort: 30001

  ## The port nubmer the proxy will listen on for tracing spans in Zipkin data format.
  ## This is usually 9411
  # zipkinPort: 9411

  ## Sampling rate to apply to tracing spans sent to the proxy.
  ## This rate is applied to all data formats the proxy is listening on.
  ## Value should be between 0.0 and 1.0.  Default is 1.0
  # traceSamplingRate: 0.25

  ## When this is set to a value greater than 0,
  ## spans that are greater than or equal to this value will be sampled.
  # traceSamplingDuration: 500

  ## The port to listen on for Wavefront histogram distribution formatted data.
  ## This is usually 40000
  #	histogramDistPort: 40000

  ## The name of the config map providing the preprocessor rules for the Wavefront proxy.
